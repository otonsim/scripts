scripts 
=======

My Configurations and scripts for various linux stuff.

xmonad.hs - simple ghetto xmonad config [wip]

uzbl - default uzbl config with a solidified color scheme, and a minimal bar format.

start.css/html - a crappy startpage I made for myself, with complete herp derp in mind. 
                 to use startpages like this, just set your browsers homepage to the location of the files.
                 example 'file:///path/to/crappy/startpage/start.html'

userChrome.css - a minimal[visually] firefox theme. Read the comments in the file for a better description.
                 create a firefox profile by issuing the command 'firefox -p' in a terminal
                 follow the profile creation diologue.
                 create the chrome directory  'mkdir ~/.mozilla/firefox/*profile name*/chrome'
                 place the userChrome.css file in ~/.mozilla/firefox/*profile name*/chrome/

                 it requires no visual plugins. I hope to make it usable for everyone, and the new firefox UI.
